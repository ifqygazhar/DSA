## O(1) - Constant Time

- **Explanation:** An operation with O(1) time complexity means the execution time does not depend on the amount of data. Example: direct access to an element in a Map or List by index.
- **Code example:** See the [`o(1).dart`](<./o(1).dart>) file.

## O(n) - Linear Time

- **Explanation:** An operation with O(n) time complexity means the execution time increases as the amount of data increases. Example: searching for an element in a List by iteration.
- **Code example:** See the [`o(n).dart`](<./o(n).dart>) file.
